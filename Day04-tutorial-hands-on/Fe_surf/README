pw.dos.job  : compute the spin-polarized density of states for the a 5 layers slab of Febcc(001)(pw.x + projwfc.x)


As in the example of Fe_bulk the DOS is performed in three steps (scf pw.x, nscf pw.x and projwfc.x)

First of all check the atomic structure of the system with xcrysden.
What is the distance between two slabs?

Note that K-point sampling is only in the kx,ky plane:
K_POINTS automatic
 $nK $nK 1 0 0 0

Why is it so?

Note also that the scf calculation has been performed with an nbnd=35 which is larger than the default value (ndnd=24) since otherwise you will face convergence problems...This is due to the fact that the default value of nbnd is too small for up bands.
Do you understand why?

From the general output of projwfc.x (Fe.bcc.surf001.FM.projwfc.out) extract the magnetization for the 5 atomics layers of the slab.
Plot the magnetization with respect to the atomic site.

How many projected DOS files do you have? Explain why.

Plot the projected DOS for d orbitals on the surface and central atom.
What do you notice?

--------
pw.charge-density.job  : compute the charge density (for up and dn spins) of a 5 layer slab of Febcc(001)(pw.x + pp.x)

After running a scf cycle we use post-processing.
The post-processing programm pp.x allows to analyze and plot a great variety of quantities.
In this example we use an option that allows to calculate the charge density along a given line.
We have defined a line perpendicular to the surface and passing through a surface atom.

You will obtain two files bcc.surf001.FM.charge-density.plot.up and bcc.surf001.FM.charge-density.plot.dn
Plot the charge density of up and down spins. What do you notice?
