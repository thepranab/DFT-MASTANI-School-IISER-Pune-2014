QE TDDFPT tutorial
==================


I) PREPARATION
--------------

1) Download the TDDFTtutorial_India.tar.gz file.

2) Unpack the archive:

cd ~
mv Downloads/TDDFTtutorial_India.tar.gz ~ 
tar vxfz TDDFTtutorial_India.tar.gz

3) Go to the QEtutorial file:

cd TDDFTtutorial


4) Define the path to the quantum-ESPRESSO programs:

export BINDIR=/usr/local/apps/espresso-5.1/bin


II) RUN GROUND STATE CALCULATION FOR BENZENE
--------------------------------------------

mpirun -np 4 $BINDIR/pw.x < Benzene.pw-in | tee Benzene.pw-out

III) RUN TDDFPT AND CALCULATE RECURSION COEFFICIENTS
-----------------------------------------------------

mpirun -np 4 $BINDIR/turbo_lanczos.x < Benzene.tddfpt-in | tee Benzene.tddfpt-out

This job will take a lot of time (approx 2.5 hours). You can stop it
after some iterations. A complete output file is given:

./Reference/Benzene.tddfpt-out

The important recursion coefficients are stored in the files
out/benzene.beta_gamma_z.1
out/benzene.beta_gamma_z.2
out/benzene.beta_gamma_z.3

In order to go on with the tutorial, without having computed yet all
the coefficients yet, please copy the sample file to this filename:

cp Reference/benzene.beta_gamma_z.[123] out/


IV) Compute spectra
--------------------

$BINDIR/turbo_spectrum.x < Benzene.tddfpt_pp-in

The result is given in the file benzene.plot

The lines starting with chi_x_y give the x-y components of the suseptibility tensor.
Format: 
You find in column 2: Energy [Ry]
In column 3: Re[chi(omega)]
In column 4: Im[chi(omega)]

The lines starting with S(E) give the (experimentally observed) strength function.
Format:
In column 2: Energy [Ry]
In column 3: S(E)


In order to plot the strength function (for example), you have to filter the relevant
lines from the benzene.plot file.
Example:
grep S\(E\) benzene.plot > S.dat

S.dat can be visualized using xmgrace or gnuplot.



You can compute several spectra varying in Benzene.tddfpt_pp-in

itermax0: The number of computed coefficients read from file
benzene.beta_gamma_z.[123]. This number must be <= the number of
coefficients stored in the file

itermax: The number of coefficients used in the continued fraction
with terminator. From itermax0 onwards, these coefficients will be
extrapolated

terminator: use "osc" for the even/odd terminator
            use "no" for not using a terminator


IV) Compute charge density response
-----------------------------------

mpirun -np 4 $BINDIR/turbo_lanczos.x < Benzene.tddfpt-in-s2

The result are Gaussian Cube files. You can find the result of this calculation
in the Reference/ directory:

The imaginary part of the response charge density in:
benzene-absorbtive-pol1.cube 

The real part of the response charge density in:
benzene-dispersive-pol1.cube 

Visualize the absorbtive response charge using xcrysden.

V) Given are also input and output files for turbo_davidson.x in the same
system. Note in the file Reference/benzene.eigen how many single excitations 
are involved.


V) Potential energy surface of a CO molecule
---------------------------------------------

Go to the directory CO.

Calculate the first two excited states of CO for varying C-O atomic distances.

Interpret the resulting first potential energy surface.
