All examples run in parallel, therefore make sure that QE is compiled
for parallel execution. For PSU machines, lionxi cluster is enabled 
for this purpose. To use QE, please type

module load qe/5.0

in the terminal. This will also load the necessary intel and mkl modules.
The mkl module is also needed for U calculation examples, in order to 
link resp_mat.f90 to blas libraries. 

All examples contain folders "Reference" that has results from
previously finished calculations. Use them to compare with your own 
results. 

################
Example 1: FeO
################

All the scripts are self-explanatory. 

1. run_FeO_NO_U performs the GGA calculation for FeO and also the projected DOS.
2. run_FeO_U performs the GGA+U calculation for FeO and the projected DOS. This 
calculation yields a metallic state.
3. run_FeO_U2 performs the GGA+U calculation and the projected DOS. In this case,
the eigenvalues of the occupation matrices are interrupted after the 1st iteration
to "suggest" the code the right local energy minimum. This is performed by the
variable starting_ns_eigenvalue.

################
Example 2: NiO
################
 
This example deals with the U calculation for NiO. 

The script run_NiO_r16_ucalc performs the supercell calculations and 
the perturbed runs using Hubbard_alpha. The results are written in
the file results_NiO which are analysed by the scripts in folder Ucalc.

When you go into the folder Ucalc, make sure that the scripts 
comp_resp_mat.j and grepnalfa_nio_r16 are executable. If not, please
type:

chmod +x grepnalfa_nio_r16
chmod +x comp_resp_mat.j

in order to make them executable. Make sure that the mkl libraries are installed. 
Check this by typing:

module list

If you do not see mkl, please type

module load qe/5.0

This will load QE, as well as the required mkl libraries for PSU machines. If you 
are running the calculation at some other machine, make sure that you have some
blas library on your machine. To link to the correct library, please edit
comp_resp_mat.j.

The U calculation is simply performed by typing ./ucalc_nio_r16.j, which
incorporates all the other scripts within the folder Ucalc.

Detailed description of this calculation are provided in the slides.

Example 3: Cu2O
################

This example is left as an exercise. The solutions are provided in the Reference folders.
