   Variable:       diago_thr_init

   Type:           REAL
   Description:    Convergence threshold for the first iterative diagonalization
                   (the check is on eigenvalue convergence).
                   For scf calculations, the default is 1.D-2 if starting from a
                   superposition of atomic orbitals; 1.D-5 if starting from a
                   charge density. During self consistency the threshold (ethr)
                   is automatically reduced when approaching convergence.
                   For non-scf calculations, this is the threshold used in the
                   iterative diagonalization. The default is conv_thr / nelec.
                   For 'phonon' calculations, diago_thr_init is ignored:
                   the threshold is always set to  conv_thr / nelec .
